# GradeOptimizer
This app is essentially a todo-list app, which implements the pomodoro technique for each task.
The pomodoro technique is a productivity strategy - work for 25 minutes, and reward yourself with a 5 minute break.
This will help you stay focused on a given task and not procrastinate as much.

In writing this program I used and learned about the following concepts:

- object-oriented programming
- MVC (model view controller) architecture for this application
- Activity lifecycle
- Localization
- Communicating and passing information to new activities with intents
- Fragments, Fragment Arguments, Fragment Transactions, and using Pager to switch between fragments
- using RecyclerView to display lists
- programming toolbar button
- implementing an SQLite database for long term storage of memory

Note: didn't implement support for rotating screen yet
